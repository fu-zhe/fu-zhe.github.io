## About Me

I am a Research Scientist at **Apsara Lab** and a Technical Research Expert in the **Database Business Unit** at **[Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/)**, where I work at the intersection of **large language models (LLMs)**, **intelligent operations (AIOps)**, **distributed systems**, and **cloud security**.

My research focuses on building *intelligent, autonomous, and reliable* cloud infrastructure by combining cutting-edge AI with real-world system challenges. I aim to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and large-scale computing systems — making them not only more powerful, but also self-aware, self-diagnosing, and self-healing.

I am currently leading the development of **AI-powered operational assistants** that leverage **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Agent-based architectures** to support database on-call engineers. These systems automatically retrieve relevant knowledge, analyze incidents, and provide actionable recommendations — reducing mean time to response (MTTR) and significantly improving on-call efficiency.

I received my Ph.D. (2018) and B.S. (2013) in **[Automation](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/)** from **[Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/)**. During my doctoral studies, I was a member of the **[NSLab](https://tsinghua-nslab.org/)** and a visiting student at the **[University of Southern California (USC)](https://www.usc.edu/)** (2016–2017).

My work is driven by a simple belief: *the future of cloud computing lies in systems that understand themselves*. I am committed to advancing this vision — one line of code, one model, and one real-world deployment at a time.
