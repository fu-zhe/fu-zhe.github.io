I am a Research Scientist at **Apsara Lab** and a Technical Research Expert in the **Database Business Unit** at Alibaba Cloud, where I work at the intersection of **large language models**, **intelligent operations (AIOps)**, **distributed systems**, and **cloud security**.

My research focuses on building *intelligent, autonomous, and reliable* cloud infrastructure by combining cutting-edge AI with real-world system challenges. I aim to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and large-scale computing systems — making them not only more powerful, but also self-aware, self-diagnosing, and self-healing.

I am currently leading the development of **AI-powered operational assistants** that leverage **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** and **Agent-based architectures** to support database on-call engineers. These systems automatically retrieve relevant knowledge, analyze incidents, and provide actionable recommendations — reducing mean time to response (MTTR) and significantly improving on-call efficiency.

I received my Ph.D. in **Automation** from **Tsinghua University** in 2018, and my B.S. in **Automation** from the same institution in 2013. During my doctoral studies, I was a **Visiting Student at the University of Southern California (USC)** from 2016 to 2017, where I collaborated on research in machine learning and intelligent systems.

My work is driven by a simple belief: *the future of cloud computing lies in systems that understand themselves*. I am committed to advancing this vision — one line of code, one model, and one real-world deployment at a time.
